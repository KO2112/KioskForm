            What Is a Modular / Portable Kiosk?
          </h2>
            <div className="prose max-w-none text-gray-700">
             <p>
                A modular or portable kiosk is a prefabricated, self-contained unit designed for flexible deployment across various environments.
                These kiosks can be quickly installed and relocated, making them ideal for temporary or semi-permanent use.
                Common applications include security kiosks on construction sites, ticket booths at events or parking areas, and catering units in hospitals or outdoor venues.
                Their versatility and ease of setup make them a smart choice for industries needing adaptable, functional spaces without the hassle of permanent construction.

                The landscape of commercial spaces has been transformed by the rise of modular kiosks across the UK. These versatile
                structures have evolved from simple vendor stalls into sophisticated, multi-functional spaces that serve as the backbone
